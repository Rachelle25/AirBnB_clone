AirBnB Clone ‚Äï The ALX-Holberton BnB

hbnb



Description of the project

The ALX-Holberton B&B sums up the implementation of my four months of studies at the ALX-Holberton School - the fullstack software engineering program. The goal of the project is to deploy a replica of the Airbnb Website using my server. The final version of this project will have:



1. A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like a shell (for development and debugging)

2. A website (front-end) with static and dynamic functionalities

3. A comprehensive database to manage the backend functionalities

4. An API that provides a communication interface between the front and backend of the system.

5. General concepts in review
